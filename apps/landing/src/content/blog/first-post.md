# Welcome to BETA Stack

This is a **demo repo** that shows how **Bun**, **Elysia** (with Eden Treaty), **Tailwind** (with daisyUI), and **Astro** work together.

## What you'll find here

- A minimal **monorepo** with two apps: API and landing.
- **Blog** content written in Markdown and rendered with Astro content collections.
- A small **login** section that uses **Eden Treaty** so the frontend and backend share the same TypeScript types.
- **SEO** setup: meta tags, sitemap, JSON-LD, and more.

Enjoy exploring the stack.
